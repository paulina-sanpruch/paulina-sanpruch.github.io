<p>Hi, I'm Paulina. I live in Poland, Cracow. I've been drawing since childhood. Over time, I was discovering different techniques, from pencil sketching to computer graphics.</p>


<h3>Education</h3>

<p>I have finished a high school of fine arts in Kielce. My paintings were presented on a few exhibitions, including my own.
I studied architecture and urban planning at the Cracow University of Technology and have a MSc degree in architectural engineering.
I learned there principles of design and construction, as well as application of 3D computer graphics in visualisations.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>After graduation I decided to develop myself in the direction of computer graphics. I worked in a company producing
mobile applications for children on tablets and smartphones. My responsibilities included 2D animations, drawing
illustrations and designing characters to be used in educational fables for kids.</p>

<p>Parallel to the full-time job, I have been doing freelance work for marketing agencies and engineering firms: illustrations,
logo design and technical drawings.</p>

<h3>Technical skills</h3>

<p>I am well versed in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD, 3D Studio Max.</p>
